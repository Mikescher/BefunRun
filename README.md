========

A simple command line program to execute befunge-93 code.
The first parameter is expected to be a file with valid befunge-93 code.
All output is redirected to stdout. *(Errors end up in stderr)*

Like all programs in my [BefunUtils](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils) collection this supports befunge-93 code with extended grid size (bigger than 80x25, see [BefunExec](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunExec))

Download
========

You can download the binaries from my website [www.mikescher.com](http://www.mikescher.com/programs/view/BefunUtils)

Set Up
======

*This program was developed under Windows with Visual Studio.*

You don't need other [BefunUtils](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils) projects to use this.  
Theoretically you can only clone this repository and start using it.  
But it could be useful to get the whole BefunUtils solution like described [here](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunUtils/blob/master/README.md)
